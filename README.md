## Exploration of Machine Learning, Analytics, and Visualizations Using the Riot API

The product is being explored as a streamlit app using machine learning libraries to help players better understand their performance and update their strategies.  Intended for a small, personal audience.

The link for the streamlit app is [https://share.streamlit.io/xpgilbert/tactics_api_project](https://share.streamlit.io/xpgilbert/tactics_api_project).



### Goals include:
* use machine learning to help players find their best and worst units
* provide visualizations about placement distributions
* find a good way to score unit performance in a match and over a sequence of matches

Sources and Libraries:
* Libraries used include: os, pandas, sklearn, [riotwatcher](https://riot-watcher.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
* Riot API can be found [here](https://developer.riotgames.com/)
