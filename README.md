### Goals include:
* use machine learning to help players find their best and worst units
* provide visualizations about placement distributions
* find a good way to score unit performance in a match and over a sequence of matches

Sources and Libraries:
* Libraries used include: os, pandas, [riotwatcher](https://riot-watcher.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
